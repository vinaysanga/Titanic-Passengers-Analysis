# Titanic Passengers Analysis
In this project, I employ network analysis, to explore the intricate dynamics of the Titanic disaster . The analysis covers co-occurrence patterns, character network construction, community detection and centrality analysis.

## 1. Introduction

There is barely someone who doesnâ€™t know about the Titanic disaster, more people died than survived. But it begs an interesting question. "How did social networks, or connections between passengers, influence survival rates aboard the Titanic?". Was it just a chance of fate or there was a pattern which led to some people having more chances of survival than the others. We will take a look at the same things using network analysis and touch upon some interesting facts about the disaster.

## 2. Dataset 
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **PassengerId**: An identifier for each passenger.
- **Survived**: Indicates if the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
- **Pclass**: The class of the ticket the passenger purchased (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
- **Name**: The name of the passenger.
- **Sex**: The gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: The age of the passenger.
- **SibSp**: The number of siblings or spouses the passenger had aboard the Titanic.
- **Parch**: The number of parents or children the passenger had aboard the Titanic.
- **Ticket**: The ticket number.
- **Fare**: The fare the passenger paid.
- **Cabin**: The cabin number where the passenger stayed.
- **Embarked**: The port where the passenger embarked the Titanic.
